          <h2>Reinforcement Learning Project</h2>
          <p class="lead">Behavioural science draws conclusions through the results of behavioural observations. In particular, it is trying to predict animal's internal states and processes based on indirect measurements and/or observations of the animal's behaviour. Cognitive science endeavors for years on revealing the content of the black box, as revealing the inner workings between input (stimuli) and output (response).

The aim of our project was an implementation of a framework with models that imitate animal's behaviour and to evaluate, which model fits best animal's behaviour. This allows us to reveal the inner workings on the basis of very simple observations. The evaluation framework is composed of two components: models and evaluation. The framework's input are data, that describe a simple animal's behaviour in a form of trajectories in space and time. Models are  fitted to the data, which in term generates new trajectories with fitted parameters. A newly generated trajectory is compared with an original one and an evaluation method returns an information about which model  fits better to the inputs. The selected model reveals an underlying inner structure.</p>
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p class="lead">The framework was implemented on a basis of a pilot study.
The design of the framework consists of two parts, divided into subparts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>simulation framework
              <ul>
                <li>environment</li>
                <li>agent</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>agent's learning process
              <ul>
                <li>evaluation</li>
                <li>reconstruction</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Simulation framework</h4>
          <p class="lead">To implement simulation we use Markov Decision Process theory, which represents agent's internal states, beliefs and desires, its planning process and its interaction with the environment and encodes environment's limits (see Appendix A).

To train an agent to imitate animals behaviour we used reinforcement learning. RL is a computational approach, that addresses the problem of how agents should learn to take actions to maximize cumulative reward through interactions with an environment (see Appendix B).</p>
          <h4>Models</h4>
          <p class="lead">Each model stands for every hypothesis. A model describes a trajectory in terms of differential equations using x, y positions, x, y velocities, angle, angular velocity and position of an object on agent's retina at each time point.

Three different models were implemented. A model that describes an animal approaching a goal, an animal that is avoiding an obstacle and reflexive & goal oriented model as a combination of first two. A code snippet can be found in an Appendix C.</p>
          <h4>Evaluation</h4>
          <p class="lead">Training is guided through cumulative reward, which is a good metric to evaluate models.</p>

          <h2>LSTM Autoencoder Project</h2>
          <p class="lead">Carsharing companies encounter plenty of unreported damages on cars, which ends up being quite costly. The idea of the project was to implement a system that would detect damages in real time using simple vibration sensors. To determine whether a signal means that actual damage occured or a driver was simply driving on a gravel we used a machine learning algorithm.</p>
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p class="lead">Each system gets calibrated for every type of a car. During calibration phase we collected signals and converted them into audio files. The data got preprocess and fit to a model. In production phase the data get stored in a cloud where a pretrained model is used for classification.</p>
          <h4>LSTM Autoencoder</h4>
          <p class="lead">Autoencoder consist of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. Once fit the encoder compresses the data, whereas the decoder reconstructs an original signal. The general idea of autoencoder is that the model is trained only on non-anomalous data, therefore a compression and a reconstruction of an original signal of anomalous data will result in bigger reconstruction error.

A Figure 1 shows reconstruction error for anomalous and non-anomalous data. As expected such model gives positive results (see Figure 2). An example of a model implementation can be found in an Appendix D.</p>
